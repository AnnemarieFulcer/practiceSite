<h2>I'm going to go ahead and keep the Markdown Language details here in case I need them for later</h2>
_Even though you said we wouldn't be using it for our site this is a pretty good reference I can have for later_

- Class year: Junior 
- Major: HCI
- Short term goal: Sleep
- Long term goal: Domination 

Here's my LinkedIn because I'm all about that networking -It's probably not that impressive but I'm working on it

Honestly, I don't have a full picture of his vision but he's working on the hardware and backend coding and I'm working on front end UX and right now I'm trying to figure out a way to dynamically search as the user is typing. 
It's in Python, which I haven't done _much_ with but CodeAcademy exists for a reason, right? Anyways, here's that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annemarie-fulcer/">link</a>
