<h2>I'm going to go ahead and keep the Markdown Language details here in case I need them for later</h2>
_Even though you said we wouldn't be using it for our site this is a pretty good reference I can have for later_
<br>
Before that though, I'll write some content I guess...<br>

**Here's some info about me**
- Class year: Junior 
- Major: HCI
- Short term goal: Sleep
- Long term goal: Domination 

It's interesting that the h1 tag seems to work but not # the pound symbol even if i put it #right next to the words. I'll have to play around with it. 

###will this work? It Works in the preview in webstorm I'll see...






You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/AnnemarieFulcer/practiceSite/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
